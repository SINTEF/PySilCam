        A Python interface to the SilCam.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Acqusition of images from SilCam
        * Real-time processing of SilCam images, particle statistics
        * Processing images from disk (batch or real-time)
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        some setup:
            > conda create -n pysilcam python=2.7
            > source activate pysilcam
            > python setup.py install
        
        To process images from disk in real time (watching a folder for new images):
        
            > PYSILCAM_REALTIME_DATA='<path>' MPLBACKEND='TkAgg' silcam-acquire process pysilcam/config_example.ini
        
        for real-time listening processing:
            > PYSILCAM_FAKEPYMBA=ON PYSILCAM_REALTIME_DATA='<path>' MPLBACKEND='TkAgg' silcam-acquire process pysilcam/config_example.ini
        
        for fast acquisition only (no processing):
            > silcam-acquire
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Python = 3.4
        
        * numpy
        
        * Pymba with Python 3 support. Install using
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/mabl/pymba@python3
        
        
        * For Python 2, the master branch Pymba is required. Install it with
        
            pip install -e git+https://github.com/morefigs/pymba#egg=pymba
